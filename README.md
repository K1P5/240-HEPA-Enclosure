This is a panel-mount style frame that houses a generic, affordable HEPA filter and charcoal pre-filter (example of compatible unit shown within gallery). The frame/enclosure contains mounting positions for two 120mm DC fans, wired in parallel or series, and allows for a range of configurations based on cost and need. I originally designed this to solve a cat problem. One of two is very picky about the lingering odor within the litter box, regardless of cleaning schedule. After a series of litter box upscaling projects (40 gallon bin, magnetic swing door) I finally turned my attention to the odor issue. This HEPA enclosure performs an effective job of turning over the internal volume of the container and now I finally have a satisfied animal. I am currently preparing a second enclosure to test as a 3D Printer Chamber Filter. Use cases will vary. 

Misc. Notes:

The main components are relatively large in size and can be printed on a 330mm x 230mm build plate. PLA has proven to work well for the large parts, PETG for the hinge and latch components.

I use generic 18-8 SS M3 hardware all around as that is what I keep on hand.

Most generic barrel plug panel mount style connectors are compatible with the enclosure.
